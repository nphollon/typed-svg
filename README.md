# typed-svg

The goal is simply to make it more pleasant to work with SVG in Elm.

Right now this library is just a helper for [elm-lang/svg]("http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest"). It creates SVG attributes with functions that take typed arguments. (not just strings!)

Eventually, we may aim to completely replace elm-lang/svg, perhaps using a builder framework akin to evancz/graphics. But that's only if such a thing would be useful.

Questions, experience reports, and insane prophecies are always welcome!
