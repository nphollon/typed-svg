- "fill" has a separate usage for animation elements

- All presentation attributes have "inherit" as an option. Is this actually useful?

- Support for CSS length units adds bulk to the interface. Should there be convenience functions for using unitless lengths? For example, instead of `cx (num 20)`, there would be `cx 20`. Maybe in a separate module.
